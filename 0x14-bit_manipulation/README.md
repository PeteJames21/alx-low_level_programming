# Bit Manipulation

## 0-binary_to_uint.c
Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
- Return: the converted number, or 0 if:
	- there is one or more chars in the string `b` that is not `0` or `1`
	- `b` is `NULL`

## 1-print_binary.c

- Conversion is only done using bitwise manipulation without use of / or %
