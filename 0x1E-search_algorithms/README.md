# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms
Implentation of search algorithms using the C programming language

## 0-linear.c
Write a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear Search algorithm.
- Every time a value in the array is compared to the element being sought, the value is printed.

## 1-binary.c
Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm.
- The array is assumed to be sorted in ascending order.
- It is assumed that the value to be searched for occurs only once in the array.
- The array is printed every time it changes.
